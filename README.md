# hljs-mdit-code-splitting

Source code of my blog: [Code splitting for highlight.js in markdown-it](https://letmutex.com/article/code-splitting-for-highlightjs-in-markdown-it)

A minimal sample to code-split when using [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) in [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

It's written in Vue 3, but this approach also works with React and others since it requires updating to the DOM directly.
